/// Connection to perform LDAP operations on an LDAP server.
///
/// There are two modes: automatic and manual.  Most programs will use the
/// default automatic mode. The mode is set by the constructor or changed using
/// the [setAutomaticMode] method.
///
/// ## Properties
///
/// An LdapConnection is defined by the network connection and the LDAP binding.
///
/// The network connection is determined by the hostname, whether SSL/TLS is
/// used or not, and the port number.  These are set by the constructor or
/// changed using the [setHost] and [setProtocol] methods.
///
/// The LDAP binding is either anonymous or authenticated.  It is set by the
/// constructor or changed using the [setAuthentication] and [setAnonymous]
/// methods.
///
/// The [badCertHandler] is a callback function to process bad certificates
/// (if encountered when attempting to establish a TLS/SSL connection).
/// The callback function should return true to accept the certificate (and
/// the security consequences of doing so), or false to reject it. If no
/// certificate callback is provided, the default behaviour is to throw
/// the [LdapCertificateException] if a bad certificate is encountered.
///
/// ## Connection management
///
/// ### State
///
/// The state of the LdapConnection can be determined by examining its [state].
///
/// ### Automatic mode vs manual mode
///
/// In automatic mode, the management of opening the network connection and
/// establishing the LDAP binding is handled automatically. The application
/// simply has to create the LdapConnection, perform LDAP operations on it, and
/// close it when finished. The application does not have to explicitly open the
/// network connection or send LDAP BIND requests, unless it wants to.
///
/// In manual mode, the application must explicitly [open] the network
/// connection and use [bind] to send LDAP BIND requests, to make the
/// LdapConnection ready to perform LDAP operations.
///
/// ### Disconnections
///
/// An open network connection can be disconnected by external causes, which are
/// outside the control of the application.  For example, disconnections occur
/// when: the LDAP server times out the connection, the LDAP server is
/// re-started, or network errors causes the connection to be dropped.
///
/// In automatic mode, the application does not have to worry about
/// disconnections. In automatic mode, the LdapConnection will be automatically
/// re-opened (and re-established any LDAP bindings) if it becomes disconnected.
/// Automatic mode was designed to support long-lived connection pooling.
///
/// In manual mode LDAP operations will fail if the LdapConnection becomes
/// disconnected.
///
/// ## LDAP operations
///
/// The available LDAP operations are:
///
/// - [bind] - performs a bind with the current authentication or an anonymous bind
/// - [search] - queries the LDAP directory for entries
/// - [compare] - compares values in LDAP entries
/// - [add] - creates a LDAP entry
/// - [delete] - removes an existing LDAP entry
/// - [modify] - changes attributes in an LDAP entry
/// - [modifyDN] - moves an LDAP entry
///
/// ### Results
///
/// All of the above LDAP operation methods return a [Future] to an [LdapResult].
///
/// The [LdapResult] contains a _resultCode_ value that will always be either
/// [ResultCode.OK], [ResultCode.COMPARE_FALSE] or [ResultCode.COMPARE_TRUE].
/// The last two values only occur when performing a _compare_ operation.  For
/// all other operations, the _resultCode_ does not carry useful information,
/// because errors will cause an exception to be thrown.
///
/// ### Exceptions
///
/// This package defines exceptions that are all subclasses of the abstract
/// [LdapResultException] class.
///
/// In automatic mode, all of them can also throw any of the exceptions the
/// [open] or [bind] methods can throw.
///
/// In manual mode, all of them can also throw [StateError] if the connection
/// is _closed_ or _disconnected_. Also, all of them except [bind] can also
/// throw [StateError] if it is in manual mode and the state is _bindRequired_.
///
/// All of the above LDAP operation methods can also thrown exceptions specific
/// to their operation. See the documentation of specific methods for some
/// of these, or the classes that implement the [LdapException]. The
/// abstract [LdapResultException] is an abstract class that is a base class
/// of exceptions relating to the result of LDAP operations.
///
/// Standard
///
/// ### Asynchronicity
///
/// All these LDAP operations
/// are asynchronous. A program does not need to wait for the current
/// operation to complete before sending the next one.
///
/// Special care must be taken with the [bind] operation in manual mode.  If
/// subsequent operations are to be performed with those LDAP bindings, the
/// application should wait for the Future returned by _bind_ to complete before
/// performing the next operation. In automatic mode, this ordering is always
/// enforced (when _bind_ is explicitly called, and when the LDAP BIND request
/// is automatically sent).
///
/// LDAP return results are matched to requests using a message id. They
/// are not guaranteed to be returned in the same order they were sent.
///
/// There is currently no flow control. Messages will be queued and sent
/// to the LDAP server as fast as possible. Messages are sent in in the order in
/// which they are queued.
///
/// ## Closing
///
/// When finished with the LdapConnection, [close] it.
