# Default test configuration file
#
# To run tests using this configuration, make sure there is no file or symlink
# called "CONFIG.yaml". See README.md for details.
#
# DO NOT CHANGE THIS FILE. To customize for a local test environment, create
# a new configuration file and a "CONFIG.yaml" symlink to it.


# This file deliberately does not define any directory configurations.
# Tests that don't require an LDAP directory will still run, so it can
# be used without requiring the tester to setup a test environment.
