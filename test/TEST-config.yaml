# LDAP configuration file

# Connection details for the test LDAP directories referenced by the
# tests. The example values here assumes they are available on ports
# 1389 and 1636 on localhost (e.g. these can be SSH tunnels to the
# actual service). If the test LDAP directory is accessed directly,
# the port values will usually be port 389 for unsecured LDAP and port
# 636 for LDAP over TLS.

# Since all the tests should pass with different types of LDAP
# directories, if different connection settings are needed for
# different LDAP directories, try to create a new file with the same
# "test-LDAP" and "test-LDAPS" connection names and symlink
# "TEST-config.yaml" to it. That will avoid editing the tests to make
# them work with different LDAP directories.
